Hi,

We are Davide, Edoardo and Ugo and we love crafting ideas combine development and marketing. 
Sometimes we are a freelancer, sometimes we are Indie Hackers, but for sure we are moving to do what we love most.

I (Davide) and Ugo are two web developers and Edoardo is a one man show in the marketing sector. 

## Why this blog
This blog bord with two goals: 
1. Write 
2. Try Gatsby 

I think that write it's a good way to interact with another people but it's very hard to maintain the habit.

Gatsby is a new framework to build very fast website and apps without the need to manage webservers (we could talk about JAMStack in another post).

Combine this two goals we would like to build a **writing habit**.
Surely this site will have more updates to enrich the experience. 

The idea is document our work, our journey, our projects to tell you about us.
